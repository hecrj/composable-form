{-| Represents a number field.

**Note:** You should not need to care about this unless you are creating your own
custom fields or writing custom view code.

-}
type alias NumberField number values =
    Field (Attributes number) String values


{-| The attributes of a NumberField.

You need to provide these to:

  - [`Form.numberField`][numberField]

[numberField]: Form#numberField

  - Its `step` is a Maybe -- `Nothing` represents the HTML attribute value of "any". If you want only integers allowed, use `Just 1`.

    , placeholder : String
    , step : Maybe number
    , min : Maybe number
    , max : Maybe number
    , htmlAttributes : List ( String, String )
    }


{-| Builds a [`Form`](Form-Base#Form) with a single `NumberField`.

**Note:** You should not need to care about this unless you are creating your own
custom fields.
